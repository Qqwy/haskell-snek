# Snek

This repo is an example implementation of the game of Snake, running in the terminal.


## How to build/run

Install GHC and Stack by following [the instructions of GHCUp](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)

- Run `stack run` to first create an executable and then run it
- Run `stack repl` to load the modules into GHCi where you can interact with them
